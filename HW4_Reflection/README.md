Design

What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?
One of the most helpful design methods was developing UML diagrams. I found it extremely helpful to create use cases to understand the various perspectives on the usefulness of our bot. Creating UML diagrams, it helped my group with the overall development process from foundation of the software to the limitations of the bot. In addition, it helps to create an emphasis on the implementations my group wanted to develop. UML diagrams gave my group great organizational control over our bot.

What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
The most difficult part of the design was understanding and rationalizing the expectations of our bot. My group was made up of different technical background, and we needed to get a grasp of what our capabilities were. I found that learning a new language and working with a database for the first time was an unexpected challenge, greatly impacting our bot progress. While it was good to learn a new language and database, I would try to work more with something I am more familiar with next time, given the time constraints of this project.

What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
I would want to try to prioritize developing UML diagrams in a future design project. Using the knowledge and experience from this project, I can see the value of UML diagrams, and how these diagrams help save investment of time and development process throughout the whole project lifespan, especially where time and money are factors of a project.

Implementation

What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?
GitHub was the most helpful in the implementing, testing, and integrating our bot project. Using GitHub, it helped as it allowed our group to divide the different methods and review the overall progress of other team members. Therefore, once everyone finished their work, we were able to merge the work to main without complications.

What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
The most difficult thing was figuring out the various imports to use, and the different resources to look at when learning such a new topic, including the use of python with firebase. Without any prior knowledge, it was a very big steep learning curve and a bigger learning process than my team anticipated. For next time, I would dedicate more time to learning and researching ahead of time before starting the project, as well as getting the team started working earlier with the lack of knowledge on the topic.

What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
I foresee using GitHub in the future projects, both on personal and professional projects, as it is a very useful and successful tools in the development process of any type of project.

Process

What was most helpful about implementing Kanban and code review in your project?
The most helpful thing about implementing Kanban and code review was the organizational aspect it created for our project. It allowed for my group to have an easy way to view and update the process of our project. GitHub’s version of Kanban enabled certain techniques including use cases, branches, linking issues, and much more into one place where everyone on the team can be on an equally informed stage about the overall process of the project.

What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
While there was not much difficulty in the process tracking, it was still difficult understanding how to use GitHub’s version of Kanban. It was hard to understanding where and how to implement certain features in the formation of a project. In addition, due to hectic schedules among everyone in the group, it was also hard to find times to do code review where everyone was available to meet and discuss the plans moving forward with each step of the process.

What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?
Using Kanban, I found that I would try to use it in future projects as it proved to be a major element in our group’s organization, meeting deadlines and a form of communication. Given information in class, it also seems to be a tool used in the workforce; therefore, I do for see using the Kanban in future development projects.

Overall

Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you’ve encountered — compare and contrast how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.
All the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes contain various benefits, as explained above. The benefits of these design methods lead to two things: organization and time. While it takes more time to implement an UML diagram for a project or a Kanban, it does provide the benefit of organization, communication, and stability within a project. On the other hand, GitHub and other resources, including Firebase, take less amount of time to implement; however, it comes with a much steeper learning curve to use and implement within the project. Using these design methods together, it helps create a great quality of work for the project and team members, promoting organization, time management, and communication.
